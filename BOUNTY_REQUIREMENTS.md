# 🎯 Bounty Submission Requirements Checklist

## Critical Requirements (Must Have)

- [ ] ✅ Bot creates REAL bounty on poidh.xyz (not simulated)
- [ ] ✅ Bounty funded with REAL ETH (visible on blockchain)
- [ ] ✅ Submissions from REAL strangers (not friends/family)
- [ ] ✅ Bot waits for poidh community to find bounty
- [ ] ✅ Autonomous evaluation with Claude AI
- [ ] ✅ Winner selected without human intervention
- [ ] ✅ Payment sent via poidh contract
- [ ] ✅ All transactions verifiable on-chain
- [ ] ✅ Open source repository (public)
- [ ] ✅ Clear README with setup instructions

## Disqualification Risks

- ❌ **Auto-generated submissions** - Bot creates fake claims
- ❌ **Self-completion** - You submit to your own bounty
- ❌ **Friend submissions** - People you know submit
- ❌ **Gaming the system** - Any artificial submissions

## Valid Approach

- ✅ Create bounty with real ETH
- ✅ Post on poidh.xyz (publicly visible)
- ✅ Promote in poidh Discord/Twitter
- ✅ Wait for organic community submissions
- ✅ Bot evaluates and pays autonomously
